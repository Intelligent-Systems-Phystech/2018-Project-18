  abstract = {Brain activity can be used as a control signal for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A powerful and widely acknowledged BMI approach, so far only applied in invasive recording techniques, uses neuronal signals related to limb movements for equivalent, multidimensional control of an external effector. Here, we investigated whether this approach is also applicable for noninvasive recording techniques. To this end, we recorded whole-head MEG during center-out movements with the hand and found significant power modulation of MEG activity between rest and movement in three frequency bands: an increase for < or = 7 Hz (low-frequency band) and 62-87 Hz (high-gamma band) and a decrease for 10-30 Hz (beta band) during movement. Movement directions could be inferred on a single-trial basis from the low-pass filtered MEG activity as well as from power modulations in the low-frequency band, but not from the beta and high-gamma bands. Using sensors above the motor area, we obtained a surprisingly high decoding accuracy of 67% on average across subjects. Decoding accuracy started to rise significantly above chance level before movement onset. Based on simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings, we show that the inference of movement direction works equally well for both recording techniques. In summary, our results show that neuronal activity associated with different movements of the same effector can be distinguished by means of noninvasive recordings and might, thus, be used to drive a noninvasive BMI.},

  title    = {l1-penalized n-way pls for subset of electrodes selection in bci experiments},
  journal  = {Journal of Neural Engineering},
  year     = {2011},
  abstract = {Recently, the N-way partial least squares (NPLS) approach was reported as an effective tool
for neuronal signal decoding and brain–computer interface (BCI) system calibration. This
method simultaneously analyzes data in several domains. It combines the projection of a data
tensor to a low dimensional space with linear regression. In this paper the L1-Penalized NPLS
is proposed for sparse BCI system calibration, allowing uniting the projection technique with
an effective selection of subset of features. The L1-Penalized NPLS was applied for the binary
self-paced BCI system calibration, providing selection of electrodes subset. Our BCI system is
designed for animal research, in particular for research in non-human primates.},

  title    = {iterative n-way partial least squares for a binary self-paced brain–computer interface in freely moving animals},
  journal  = {Journal of Neural Engineering},
  year     = {2011},
  abstract = {In this paper a tensor-based approach is developed for calibration of binary self-paced
brain–computer interface (BCI) systems. In order to form the feature tensor,
electrocorticograms, recorded during behavioral experiments in freely moving animals (rats),
were mapped to the spatial–temporal–frequency space using the continuous wavelet
transformation. An N-way partial least squares (NPLS) method is applied for tensor
factorization and the prediction of a movement intention depending on neuronal activity. To
cope with the huge feature tensor dimension, an iterative NPLS (INPLS) algorithm is
proposed. Computational experiments demonstrated the good accuracy and robustness of
INPLS. The algorithm does not depend on any prior neurophysiological knowledge and allows
fully automatic system calibration and extraction of the BCI-related features. Based on the
analysis of time intervals preceding the BCI events, the calibration procedure constructs a
predictive model of control. The BCI system was validated by experiments in freely moving
animals under conditions close to those in a natural environment.},

  title    = {spatiotemporal forward solution of the eeg and meg using network modeling},
  journal  = {IEEE},
  year     = {2002},
  abstract = {Dynamic systems have proven to be well suited to describe a broad spectrum of human coordination behavior such as synchronization with auditory stimuli. Simultaneous measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data reveals that the dynamics of the brain signals is highly ordered and also accessible by dynamic systems theory. However, models of EEG and MEG dynamics have typically been formulated only in terms of phenomenological modeling such as fixed-current dipoles or spatial EEG and MEG patterns. In this paper, it is our goal to connect three levels of organization, that is the level of coordination behavior, the level of patterns observed in the EEG and MEG and the level of neuronal network dynamics. To do so, we develop a methodological framework, which defines the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural ensembles, the neural field, on a sphere in three dimensions. Using magnetic resonance imaging we map the neural field dynamics from the sphere onto the folded cortical surface of a hemisphere. The neural field represents the current flow perpendicular to the cortex and, thus, allows for the calculation of the electric potentials on the surface of the skull and the magnetic fields outside the skull to be measured by EEG and MEG, respectively. For demonstration of the dynamics, we present the propagation of activation at a single cortical site resulting from a transient input. Finally, a mapping between finger movement profile and EEG/MEG patterns is obtained using Volterra integrals.},

  title    = {decoding finger flexion from band-specific ecog signals in humans},
  journal  = {Frontiers in Neuroscience},
  year     = {2012},
  abstract = {This article presents the method that won the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV addressed to the prediction of the finger flexion from electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals. ECoG-based BCIs have recently drawn the attention from the community. Indeed, ECoG can provide higher spatial resolution and better signal quality than classical EEG recordings. It is also more suitable for long-term use. These characteristics allow to decode precise brain activities and to realize efficient ECoG-based neuroprostheses. Signal processing is a very important task in BCIs research for translating brain signals into commands. Here, we present a linear regression method based on the amplitude modulation of band-specific ECoG including a short-term memory for individual finger flexion prediction. The effectiveness of the method was proven by achieving the highest value of correlation coefficient between the predicted and recorded finger flexion values on data set 4 during the BCI competition IV.},
