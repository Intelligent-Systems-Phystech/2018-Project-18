  abstract  = {Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) that rely upon
		 epidural electrocorticographic signals may become a
		 promising tool for neurorehabilitation of patients with
		 severe hemiparatic syndromes due to cerebrovascular,
		 traumatic or tumor-related brain damage. Here, we show
		 in a patient-based feasibility study that online
		 classification of arm movement intention is possible.
		 The intention to move or to rest can be identified with
		 high accuracy (~90%), which is sufficient for
		 BCI-guided neurorehabilitation. The observed spatial
		 distribution of relevant features on the motor cortex
		 indicates that cortical reorganization has been induced
		 by the brain lesion. Low and high-frequency components
		 of the electrocorticographic power spectrum provide
		 complementary information towards classification of arm
		 movement intention.},

  abstract   = {This article presents the method that won the
		 brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV addressed
		 to the prediction of the finger flexion from
		 electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals. ECoG-based BCIs have
		 recently drawn the attention from the community.
		 Indeed, ECoG can provide higher spatial resolution and
		 better signal quality than classical EEG recordings. It
		 is also more suitable for long-term use. These
		 characteristics allow to decode precise brain
		 activities and to realize efficient ECoG-based
		 neuroprostheses. Signal processing is a very important
		 task in BCIs research for translating brain signals
		 into commands. Here, we present a linear regression
		 method based on the amplitude modulation of
		 band-specific ECoG including a short-term memory for
		 individual finger flexion prediction. The effectiveness
		 of the method was proven by achieving the highest value
		 of correlation coefficient between the predicted and
		 recorded finger flexion values on data set 4 during the
		 BCI competition IV.},
